## 🤷‍♀️ Question Time

### 👨‍🔬 What is this?

WC NFT Fantasy is a Prediction game where you can play a game to win a prize if you guessed the winning teams right. Extending the idea of [CryptoFishx](https://twitter.com/cryptofishx/status/1572600038114873348?s=20&t=3Oq9kM_I6EdHV26yWCLSmg) we have built an application that anyone can participate and win with the confidence that noone is going to tamper or cheat in the system.

Apart from the main game, there are two more side games that you can play to win more points to have fun and earn more points!

### 🕵️ What are NFTs?

NFTs stand for Non-Fungible Tokens. They are unique on its own with different attributes per token that exists within a blockchain that you own when bought.

### 🤔 How is blockchain the solution to this?

Having it on the on chain (on the blockchain) enables us to use smart contracts which are public (anyone can see and read) immutable (once deployed it cannot be changed) code that governs everyone's interactions with the game. Which means, no third party including us can tamper with the data once set. Anyone can confirm that game works as intended by reading the code and the final prize pool is handed over to the winner by code itself so anyone can confirm that is correct.

## ⚡ Hackathon

This project was made for [Chainlink hackathon](https://chain.link/hackathon) targetting the following bounties :

- [Chainlink Price Feed](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds) - Determine how much users pay for teams.

- [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) - Stored and deployed the NFT Images and the NFT Metadata in a decentralized way so that they cannot get altered by anyone including us and, the data will always be publicly accessible.

- [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/) - We used Quicknode to deploy all our smart contracts on the network.

- [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) enables us to deploy contracts in L2 blockchain which helps handle traffic for the rush in the event of buying tickets.
